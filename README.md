Using hidden Markov models to investigate G-quadruplex motifs in genomic sequences

Last modified: 2016-12-07

## C++ and Perl programs  
The programs (g4hmm-1.0.0.tar.gz) for running HMM-based methods and regular expression-based method are available.

## Data    
The positive and negative sequence data (Seq.tar.gz) used in this work are available.  
In addition, actual probability parameters used in computational experiments are HMMs_pos50.tar.gz for 50 training sequences and HMMs_pos100.tar.gz for 100 training sequences.
