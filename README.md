# G4 detection using HMM
**Using hidden Markov models to investigate G-quadruplex motifs in genomic sequences**

Last updated: 2016-12-07

## C++ and Perl programs  
The programs (**g4hmm-1.0.0.tar.gz**) for running HMM-based methods and regular expression-based method are available.

## Data    
The positive and negative sequence data (**Seq.tar.gz**) used in this work are available.  
In addition, actual probability parameters used in computational experiments are **HMMs_pos50.tar.gz** for 50 training sequences and **HMMs_pos100.tar.gz** for 100 training sequences.
